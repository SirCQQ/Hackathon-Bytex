Bytex Hackathon Brief

The Intro 

If you read this page, it means that you already know the theme of this year’s Bytex internal hackathon - designing a gamified MVP to replace one part of the recruitment process with an interactive user experience that will help us differentiate in the local market especially. 

This theme is even more relevant this year perhaps than any other because of the high volume of positions we’ve got open and the possibility of growth we’re facing here at Bytex. 

The Brief

// welcome to the partay!

In order for you to easily meet the criteria for this hackathon, we’ve decided to hand out this document, where we’ve chosen a ‘for instance’ - an example to help you get going. Don’t forget that for any non-technical questions you might have, we’ve got mentors here to help you through the process. 

// world’s shortest intro to gamification

It’s a technique used to integrate gameplay elements into a non-playing setting. This technique generally uses human-focused design principles in feature creation and in building the user experience. 

If at the beginning of the technological era, digital products used to be about functionality, now they’ve migrated towards the interests of users. It’s become relevant to design processes that are pleasant for the people who use them. 

// brief directions 

One way to gamify recruitment would be to create an entire gamified framework where you bring together functionalities such as technical challenges that users have to complete, upskilling opportunities through courses and interactive tests, badges and points earned linked to a shop or to premium features, etc. While it isn’t necessarily feasible to create this kind of complex product during a hackathon, it’s perhaps one of the most illustrative examples of what gamification can look like. 

Another way to gamify recruitment would be to create a literal game-setting where different parts of the game test for different types of responses or psychological indicators. For instance, the game Papers, please is an insightful way into a player’s priorities. If asked to play it sincerely, it can be used to understand different behavioral markers of players. A game operating on similar principles could be designed for people culture and psychological assessments. 

From gamifying parts of the technical interview to psychological and people culture assessments, everything can be turned into a fun experience for the user, so in the end it’s up to you which part of the process you want to gamify, keeping in mind the adjudication criteria.

// Examples of psychological assessments that you can design include: 

Personality tests
Achievement tests
Attitude tests
Aptitude tests
Emotional intelligence tests
Neuropsychological tests
Projective tests
Observation tests
